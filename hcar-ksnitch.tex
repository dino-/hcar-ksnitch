This project is the server-side software for Kitchen Snitch, a mobile application that provides health inspection scores, currently for the Raleigh-Durham area in NC, USA. The data can be accessed on maps along with inspection details, directions and more.

\vspace{5mm}

The back-end software provides a REST API for mobile clients and runs services to perform regular inspection data acquisition and maintenance.

\vspace{5mm}

Kitchen Snitch has been in development for over a year and is running on AWS. The mobile client and server were released for public use in April of 2016 after a beta-test period.
